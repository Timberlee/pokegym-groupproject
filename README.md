# POKEGYM GROUP PROJECT ![GYARADOS!](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/x-y/normal/gyarados-f.png)

### DESCRIPTION
Our pokemon trainers are now gym leaders! In teams of three, we built a web app that highlights our individual Pokemon through a singular theme. This project was an exercise in collaboration and version control through git.

### DESIGN
Instead of creating a simple site that pulls up each trainer's pokemon, we wanted to tell a story with our group site.
Like the game, we wanted it to seem like our pokemon trainer was walking through a gym and interacting with each gym leader.
Water and aquatic themes were applied throughout the entire site.

### LANGUAGES USED
HTML, CSS, JAVSASCRIPT, SASS, GIT

### RESOURCES

For this project, the following resources and frameworks were utilized in building the site:

- [Lemon CSS Framework](https://appalaszynski.github.io/lemon/): provided the grid framework
- [Pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/): images from the official Pokemon and Nintendo.
- [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): tool for simple site animations
