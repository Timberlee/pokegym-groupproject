# POKEGYM GROUP PROJECT

### DESCRIPTION
This project was an exercise in collaboration and version control through git.

### DESIGN
Instead of creating a simple site that pulls up each trainer's pokemon, we wanted to tell a story with our group site.
Like the game, we wanted it to seem like our pokemon trainer was walking through a gym and interacting with each trainer.

### LANGUAGES USED
HTML, CSS, JAVSASCRIPT, SASS, GIT


### RESOURCES

For this project, the following resources and frameworks were utilized in building the site:

- [Lemon CSS Framework](https://appalaszynski.github.io/lemon/): provided the grid framework
- [Pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/): images from the official Pokemon and Nintendo.
- [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): tool for simple site animations
